Despite the extra precautions, de Ruyter enjoyed interacting with regular South Africans, who often encouraged him to persevere in his role.

Months later, the girl's father, who was the general manager at Mitsubishi South Africa, approached the author and said that he was his daughter's biggest hero. The father asked for a selfie with the author, which he fondly remembers. Despite receiving criticism and being called useless by some, the author felt encouraged by the support he received for his long-term plans for Eskom. Nevertheless, by September 2022, the author felt that his situation was becoming untenable as he faced immense pressure from certain opposition parties and the ANC's RET faction to do something drastic about the power crisis.\n",
      "In this excerpt, the author reflects on a difficult time in his tenure as CEO of Eskom, the South African electricity company. He describes the eroding political support for his position due to frequent power outages and a strained relationship with Pravin Gordhan, the minister of public enterprises. The author recounts a meeting in which Gordhan criticized Eskom, and the CEO was willing to resign in response. There is further discussion among political figures about the impact of the power outages on the ANC's political future, and the author expresses doubts about the sustainability of his position in light of corruption scandals and other challenges facing the company.\n",

Personal safety was also a concern, after several assassinations of whistle-blowers who exposed corruption, as it could be the result of the corrupt money flowing through the sewers.\n",

      "The author describes a helicopter trip to the Kusile power station in a state of loadshedding crisis. The author is dressed in overalls and safety boots while the plant manager is dressed formally and not prepared for a site visit. The author becomes frustrated with the lack of urgency exhibited by the senior staff members and calls for the meeting to begin. The author becomes increasingly agitated as messages about failing generating units come in and coal quality is discussed. The author becomes angry with the coal manager, who continues to eat while being questioned, and ultimately rebukes him for not doing his job. The issue of poor-quality coal, which leads to broken mills and excessive fuel oil use, is described, as well as the corruption involved in obtaining and delivering it. The author discusses the extra effort and expense required to combat these issues.\n",
      "The extract describes a meeting with the managers of the Kusile power plant, during which the author points out the poor quality of coal used to generate electricity. The author tells the managers that there are measures they could take to ensure that sub-par coal is not used, such as automatic quality-control machines. Additionally, the author stresses the importance of managing the streams of coal, water, emissions and ash that power plants produce. The author criticizes the Kusile managers for their poor management and strategic planning, which led to a crisis when the plant ran out of coal a month earlier. The author offers solutions, such as building a coal conveyor from the mine, but is frustrated with the lack of action from the managers. The author later visits the Kendal power plant, finding it to be well-maintained.\n",
      "The author visits the Kendal power station, where the plant manager admits that there is \"a lot of work to be done.\" At a mass meeting with the workers, the author offers inspiration and patriotism and challenges one union leader to explain loadshedding to 'the gogos, the matriculants in the townships who cannot study because you are not doing your job.' Another issue crops up during this meeting, as union leaders are unsatisfied with their salaries. The author questions whether this admission from staff contributes even more to Eskom's ability to save itself, especially if members of staff are unwilling to engineer improvement in their power plants out of dissatisfaction with their working conditions. The author also visits Majuba Power Station, which suffered from corruption in the procurement process. As the Eskom CEO, it is clear that micromanaging the workforce is not feasible with over 40,000 employees to oversee.\n",
      "The Kriel plant has turned its housekeeping around and won the award for best-maintained power plant. The change was implemented by a new station manager, regardless of gender or race, emphasizing the importance of attitude, purpose and mentality in driving excellence. However, during a visit to the Camden power station in September 2022, the plant had been taken offline due to water contamination. Suspicions were raised that someone had opened a valve to let dirty water into the system. When the plant manager was contacted, they were resting at home outside of site. On arrival at the plant, poor housekeeping and tight gate security further complicated the issue.\n",
      "In his book 'At the deep end', Eskom's former CEO, Matshela Koko, describes his visit to a water treatment plant, following an incident. A valve was left open for eleven days causing water shortages in Johannesburg; the problem was found to have originated from this water treatment plant. The CEO discovered that the project designed to eliminate human error had been cancelled; it had been deemed a single point of failure. Koko also found a leadership gap when the station manager could not be found to have visited the plant before or after the incident. Koko's investigation found many examples of neglectful housekeeping, the accumulation of a lot of rubbish and dust across control stations, and revealed a complete lack of leadership which had led to an unexpected outage.\n",
      "During a Gemba walk, the author discovered that Eskom was lacking in leadership. The workers were lounging about on the grass, and their superiors were failing to provide guidance and attention. On the walk, the author emphasised the importance of starting with the basics and fixing small problems before they escalate into big issues. After her talk, the water purification manager disclosed that Camden workers had suddenly stopped following orders when load-shedding levels increased. The author’s inspection led to the Camden water plant’s repair, suggesting that leadership needs to be more hands-on to address Eskom’s issues.\n",

      "After a difficult month for Eskom, the company's board was under intense scrutiny from both politicians and social media, with many calling for chairman Professor Malegapuru Makgoba and the rest of the board to be replaced. Pravin Gordhan was under pressure to act, and while rumours swirled that the board would be replaced, he did not formally consult with anyone. During a press conference, Gordhan announced the new board members and apologised for his actions. Professor Makgoba was replaced by Mpho Makwana, with many of the new appointments being confidants of Gordhan. Gordhan was already in the habit of getting involved in operational minutiae, bypassing the board, the CEO, and other senior managers at Eskom.\n",
      "The extract describes the author's frustration with the new non-executive chairman of Eskom, Mpho, and his management approach. The author believes that Mpho is not being entirely truthful, micromanaging him with unnecessary weekly goals and making statements to the press without consulting with management. The author also notes that Mpho is delaying important decisions and disregarding common practices. This includes signing letters to ministers and approving an international trip for the CEO. The author suggests that Mpho should focus on long-term strategy and work collaboratively with management instead of micromanaging.\n",
      "After being awarded a nearly R9-billion loan to accelerate South Africa's decarbonisation, the CEO of Eskom couldn't get his overseas trip approved due to the process stalled on Mpho's desk, for approval from the full board. At the first meeting of the new Eskom board, Mpho presented an outdated presentation from 2010. Some members were not up-to-date on energy issues, and a new pattern of micromanaging Eskom's operations had developed. The new board also wanted to have a business and operations committee, which was highly unusual for a non-executive board. The meeting focused on the CEO's monthly board report, but one of the new board members suggested that loadshedding should be preceded by a board decision.\n",
      "The extract describes a board meeting at Eskom where the issue of loadshedding was discussed. The former chief nuclear officer Clive le Roux emphasised that the board should focus on long-term planning and leave day-to-day management decisions to the management team. The board also discussed vetting by the State Security Agency, which was not deemed mission-critical, and the CEO's travel arrangements. The board's meddlesome behaviour led to a lack of trust in top management, and their involvement in routine details demonstrated that they did not fully understand their roles. There were also concerns over state control when the Treasury officials asked Eskom not to send out a press release about a loan, as it may impact the ANC's leadership election.\n",
      "This extract highlights the inefficiencies and internal issues at Eskom. The non-executive board members waste time by contacting employees who are experts in their narrow field but don't have a big enough picture to make an impact, causing incomplete information. The green energy projects had warning signs everywhere, and the head of the green energy program, Mandy, resigned after being taken for granted by the government. The government officials lacked HR skills, and their employees were widely under-appreciated. The focus was on dealing with cadres seeking deployment, rather than retaining key employees. The boardroom battles continued while operational disasters kept piling up, with Kusile and Medupi power stations built hastily and shoddily. Due to lower quality coal and boiler defects, Kusile had a higher risk of ash and slurry carryover into the stack, with an inexperienced team running the flue gas desulphurisation unit.\n",
      "Poor project management and inadequate communication between companies led to a build-up of ash, limestone and gypsum in a lobster joint in Eskom's power station, causing it to collapse and three units to shut down. This will lead to a delay of a year and 2,000 MW being unavailable. The disaster could have been prevented if the system's mass balance had been determined. The gypsum will eventually be sold off to manufacturers of ceiling and partition boards.\n",

Despite being aware of the impending results of this review being shared publicly and the new board's promises of accountability, the protagonist interrupts the review to submit his resignation letter. He had already polished his resignation letter as he saw there was no reasonable prospect of working productively with the new board, with the political support evaporating, and the previous board fired. Furthermore, the new board had unusual governance that bypassed the chain of command, and their demands blurred the lines between non-executive directors and executive management.\n",
      "Former Eskom CEO André de Ruyter discusses the corruption endemic within the organisation and South African society more broadly. He highlights how the profits of corrupt individuals support the failure of state-owned enterprises and argues that corruption within South Africa has become so dominant that it has begun to fail the system which feeds it. Further, he explains that his efforts to combat corruption were becoming too successful for some, with investigations implicating high-ranking politicians, leading to extreme scrutiny from intelligence agencies.\n",
      "The extract describes the author's resignations as Eskom CEO and the events leading up to it. The author expresses concern over corruption at Eskom involving high-level government officials and the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy. The author is also frustrated with Mantashe's accusation that Eskom was 'actively agitating for the overthrow of the state' and is considering resigning due to his integrity being impugned. After submitting his resignation letter, the author agrees to stay on for an additional month to allow for the board to find a suitable successor.\n",

He also took issue with the government's policy of prohibiting payment of incentives to managerial staff, which was adversely affecting morale and employee retention. Mantashe, in turn, blamed Eskom for not building new capacity and criticized the CEO for asking for incentives during loadshedding. The meeting ended with little prospect of a solution, but scapegoating of Eskom achieved.\n",
      "The author of this extract was poisoned with cyanide which was likely added to his coffee. He began to feel sick at work and was escorted to the doctor by colleagues and had his blood tested. After being sent home, he slept for 18 hours and received the news via WhatsApp that he had been poisoned in all probability by cyanide. The results from the third blood test showed conclusively that the author had ingested cyanide. The author's cyanide levels had been obscured with the addition of sodium arsenite which has the effect of masking the cyanide in a blood test.\n",
      "In 2023, a journalist, Chris Yelland, contacted the author, who had kept quiet about being poisoned, with the intention of publishing. Simultaneously, another journalist, Erika Gibson, contacted the author with the same news. The author then informed Pravin Gordhan and Mpho Makwana about the situation, with Gordhan showing concern and making an effort to visit the author. However, Mpho's response was dismissive.\n",

      "An alleged assassination attempt on the head of a national power utility, the South African author of the book, being interviewed by two female sergeants on the case, complained of their lack of comprehension regarding the seriousness of the case. Based on their apparent ignorance of the difference between 'cyanide and sinuses,' and despite his showing them the word cyanide in his statement, he cut short the interview, calling it a 'debacle,' and opted to hire a private investigator and forensic analyst and launched his own investigation. Moreover, the core evidence, including the personalized mug, led to further investigations revealing that he may have been poisoned with some kind of insecticide as opposed to cyanide.\n",
      "Following a series of frustrations including being poisoned and humiliated by the chairman, the former CEO of Eskom gave an explosive interview with Annika Larsen of eNCA where he shared findings from his private investigation, revealing the existence of four criminal cartels targeting Eskom in Mpumalanga and the link to a \"senior politician\". He later regrets giving the green light for the interview to air ahead of schedule, as the ANC threatened legal action for making accusations of corruption against them. Despite this, he stands by his statements and says he was speaking truth to power.\n",
      "Former Eskom CEO, Matshela Koko, was urged by South African politicians to stay out of open political debates once he resigned from his position. Koko, however, stated that he is not a “right-wing” politician nor does he entertain open political debates as CEO of Eskom. Koko is worried about his security, stating that after his disclosures about Eskom’s corruption, he was told that the cartels were angry with him and believed that he knew too much. Koko agreed to resign in 2017 to “relieve pressure on the fiscus” and for enabling private sector investment, reducing the need for Treasury guarantees.\n",

      "In his book, \"The Eskom Inquiry: A Judge’s Journal\", South African Judge Raymond Zondo, describes his time investigating allegations of corruption at the state power company, Eskom. Zondo says that he had misjudged the severity of the task, which had suffered from historic state neglect and a lack of investment in infrastructure. The government had also ignored warnings that the situation was urgent, and had mismanaged funds. Zondo believed that Eskom's problems could be fixed with proper management; however, his experience highlighted internal issues, such as racial quotas and a lack of professionalism, which also contributed to its problems.\n",
      "The potential catastrophic effects of a total grid collapse make it imperative that power utilities operate within a 15% margin of safety. Maintenance, safety, and discipline are top priorities in ensuring reliable operations for power stations while the income statement must be properly managed, preferably by securing cost-reflective tariffs. Corruption and fraud within the system hinder the progress towards achieving a culture of excellence and values-driven leadership.\n",
      "This passage discusses the progress made in the unbundling of Eskom and the transition to a competitive electricity market in South Africa. The author advocates for bidding farewell to the outdated idea of a vertically integrated monopolistic utility and highlights the benefits of private sector involvement in generation capacity. The author also stresses the importance of improving and expanding the grid and addressing the culture of non-payment to ensure the success of this transition. Furthermore, the author notes the challenges posed by repeated policy flip-flops and government bureaucracy in resolving this crisis. Nevertheless, the author remains optimistic about the future of renewable energy in South Africa and the potential for significantly increased generation capacity from green power projects.\n",
      "Despite government inaction, the private sector has been adding massive capacity to South Africa's power grid at no cost to Eskom or taxpayers, largely in the form of renewable energy projects. However, the author notes that Eskom's board and the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy have been resistant to some innovations, while bureaucracy and corruption have undermined efforts to bring about positive change. Nonetheless, the author takes pride in having helped to curb the rampant corruption at the utility, and he notes that Eskom's culture has shifted under new leadership. Ultimately, the author recognizes that success depends on collective action rather than individual efforts.\n",
      "The author believes that South Africa has the potential to overcome its energy crisis as it has done in the past. Leadership requires doing the right thing, and a clear setting of direction for a new growth path is necessary in the country. The author acknowledges their own efforts in trying to address the crisis and encourages their successors to build on the building blocks that have been laid. The author also addresses the possibility of failure and assures that it is important to have tried.\n",
